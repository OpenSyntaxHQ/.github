# Contributing to OpenSyntaxHQ

Thank you for contributing. We value your time and expertise.

## Quick Start

- **Check existing issues** before opening a new one
- **Open a discussion** for major changes before writing code
- **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per pull request

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation when changing behavior
- Follow existing code style and conventions

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body with more context>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Example:
```
feat: add retry logic to HTTP client

Implements exponential backoff with configurable max attempts.
Closes #42
```

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes with clear commits
4. Write or update tests
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Open a PR with a clear description

**PR descriptions should include:**
- What the change does
- Why it's needed
- How it was tested
- Any breaking changes

## Code Review

All submissions require review. Expect:

- Feedback on code quality and design
- Questions about implementation choices
- Suggestions for improvements

We review code together to ensure high quality. Feedback is about the implementation, not the person. We value your work and want to help merge it.

## Getting Help

- Check existing documentation first
- Search closed issues for similar questions
- Open a discussion for general questions
- Use issues for bugs and feature requests

## Recognition

All contributors are valued. Significant contributions will be acknowledged in release notes and project documentation.
